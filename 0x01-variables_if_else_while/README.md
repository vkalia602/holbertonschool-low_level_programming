## Description

Project 2 Low level programming series is about:
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the ```if```, ```if ... else``` statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to affect values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type ```char```, ```int```, ```unsigned int``` with ```printf```
* How to use the ```while``` loop
* How to use variables with the ```while``` loop
* How to print variables using ```printf```
* What is the ```ASCII``` character set
* What are the purpose of the ```gcc``` flags ```-m32``` and ```-m64```

    *if the number is less than 0: is negative

### 1-last_digit.c
* A program that prints the last digit of a random number and prints if its greater or less than 5
    * The output of the program should be:
      	  *The string Last digit of, followed by
	  *n, followed by
	  *the string is, followed by
	       *if n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
	       *if n is 0: the string and is 0
	       *if n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
