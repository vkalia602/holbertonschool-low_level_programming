## Description

Project 5 Low level programming series is about:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the ```gcc``` flags ```-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra```
* What are header files and how to to use them with ```#include```

## Files and Descriptions

### 0-strcat.c
* Function that concatenates two strings.
  * Prototype: ```char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src)```

### 1-strncat.c
* Function that concatenates two strings.
  * Prototype: ```char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n)```
  * _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

### 2-strncpy.c
* Function that copies a string.
    * Prototype: ```char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n)```

### 3-strcmp.c
* A function that compares two strings.
    * Prototype: ```int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)```

### 4-rev_array.c
* Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
  * Prototype: ```void reverse_array(int *a, int n)```

### 5-string_toupper.c
* Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
  *Prototype: ```char *string_toupper(char *)```

### 6-cap_string.c
* A function that capitalizes all words of a string.
    * Prototype: ```char *cap_string(char *)```

### 7-leet.c
* A function that encodes a string into 1337 (Leet).
    * Prototype: ```char *leet(char *);```

### 8-rot13.c
* A function that encodes a string using rot13.
    * Prototype: ```char *rot13(char *)```
