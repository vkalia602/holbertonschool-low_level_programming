## Description

Project 3 Low level programming series is about:
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the ```gcc``` flags ```-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra```
* What are header files and how to to use them with ```#include```

    * Prototype: ```int print_sign(int n);```
    * Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
    * Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
    * Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

### 6-abs.c
* A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

    * Prototype: ```int _abs(int);```
